## Face-Recognition-using-Siamese-Network

## Demo Video of the Model
In this video, I demonstrate the capabilities of my face recognition model. 
I uploaded a personal image that is not ideally suited for face recognition, 
showcasing how the model processes and identifies facial features. Despite the less-than-ideal input, the model effectively demonstrates its recognition capabilities.
